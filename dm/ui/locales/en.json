The advantage of the pessimistic mode is that it guarantees that the data migrated downstream will be error-free\n\n.Optimistic Mode: DDL executed on a sharded table, DM will automatically modify the statement to be compatible with other sharded tables, and immediately migrate to the downstream, without blocking the migration of any sharded table DML. The advantage of the optimistic mode is that it does not block the migration of data when dealing with DDL, but if used incorrectly, there is a risk of migration interruption or even data inconsistency.",
