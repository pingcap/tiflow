# This is a script designed for testing Avro support for Kafka sink.
# The data flow is (upstream TiDB) ==> (TiCDC) =avro=> (Kafka/JDBC connector) =sql=> (downstream TiDB)
# Developers should run "avro-local-test.sh up" first, wait for a while, run "avro-local-test.sh init", and only
# then will the data flow be established.
#
# Upstream mysql://127.0.0.1:4000
# Downstream mysql://127.0.0.1:5000
#
# This script only supports syncing (dbname = testdb, tableName = test).
# Developers should adapt this file to their own needs.
