# TiDB Data Migration Platform

[**TiDB Data Migration (DM)**](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/dm-overview) is an integrated data migration task management platform that supports full data migration and incremental data replication from MySQL or MariaDB to [TiDB](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable). It helps reduce the operations cost and simplify the troubleshooting process.

## Build

To check the code style and build binaries, you can simply run:

```bash
make build
```

Note that DM supports building with the Go version `Go >= 1.21`. For unit test preparation, see [Running/Unit Test](dm/tests/README.md#Unit-Test).

If you only want to build binaries, you can run:

```bash
make dm-worker  # build DM-worker

make dm-master  # build DM-master

make dmctl      # build dmctl
```

After DM is built successfully, you can find binaries in the `bin` directory.

## Run tests

Run all tests, including unit tests and integration tests:

See [Tests README](dm/tests/README.md) for a more detailed guide.

```bash
make test
```
